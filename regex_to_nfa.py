'''
This file contains a Python 2.7 program that determines whether a series of strings 
is in the language described by the corresponding regular expression. 
A parse tree is used to convert the regular expression to an NFA. 
The NFA is converted into a DFA, which then runs the string, and accepts or rejects.
