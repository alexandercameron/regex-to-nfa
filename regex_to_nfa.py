'''
This file contains a Python 2.7 program that determines whether a series of strings is in the language
described by the corresponding regular expression. This program uses a parse tree to convert from 
regular expressions to an NFA, and then the NFA is converted to a DFA, which then 
tests the string, and accepts or rejects.
